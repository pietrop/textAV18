Collaborative notes

* UK’s independent fact-checking charity
* Two pieces of tech we wanted to build
  * Want to monitor how often people repeat something we’ve fact-checked \(Trends\): [https://alpha.fullfact.org/live/](https://alpha.fullfact.org/live/) \(also needs credentials\)
    * Links out to stories that have referenced those claims
  * A tool that helps us live fact-check \(Live\)
    * At the moment, does the BBC channels
    * [https://alpha.fullfact.org/live/channel/pmqsdemo](https://alpha.fullfact.org/live/channel/pmqsdemo) \(probably also needs credentials\)
    * Ability to add speakers manually so you know who said what
  * A tool that listens for facts \(Check\) - yay live demos
* Claim detection
  * 25,000 annotations from 80 volunteers
  * Paper dropping on this on Friday, September 21, 2018
* Doing this also in South Africa, Argentina and Brazil, not just in the UK
* Have plans to build APIs in the future, but still in prototyping stage for what that data would look like
* There should always be a primary source for any Full Fact claim check — it’s less of this is the right answer, and more of here are the options
