# Collaborative podcast annotation workflow

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/yF-pKKshnfE" %}



Specifically, our team wanted to answer:

1. What is a good workflow to allow multiple users to annotate a piece of audio \(like a podcast\) and then turn that data into IIIF format?

2. Can we use IIIF annotations for creating a script for voice devices based on a podcast?
