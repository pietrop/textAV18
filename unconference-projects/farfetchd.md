### What is it?

It's a Chrome extension that will highlight claims in a tweet.

### Why did we develop this?

We wanted people to think twice before consuming Tweets. [Fact checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checking) is a relatively new technology that will make it easier to spot claims made by people you follow.

### Where do you see this going?

Integrating with [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/) once the API is available!
